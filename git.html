	<h4>tl;dr</h4>
	<p class="tldr-text">Basically git is a way to save your code. For every project you create what's called a repository, which you can save your progress to. If for whatever reason you mess something up, you can easily go back to a previous save and go to the code you had before. It also allows for easy collaboration across a team.</p>

                	<p>Git is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005, and has since become the most widely adopted version control system for software development.</br></br>

					As with most other distributed revision control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server. Like the Linux kernel, Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.</br></br>

					Git development began after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access to BitKeeper, a proprietary source control management system that had previously been used to maintain the project.[10] The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, had withdrawn free use of the product after claiming that Andrew Tridgell had reverse-engineered the BitKeeper protocols.</br></br>

					Torvalds wanted a distributed system that he could use like BitKeeper, but none of the available free systems met his needs, particularly in terms of performance. Torvalds took an example of an SCM system requiring thirty seconds to apply a patch and update all associated metadata, and noted that this would not scale to the needs of Linux kernel development, where syncing with fellow maintainers could require 250 such actions at a time. He wanted patching to take three seconds, and had several other design criteria in mind:</br></br>

					take Concurrent Versions System (CVS) as an example of what not to do; if in doubt, make the exact opposite decision
					support a distributed, BitKeeper-like workflow
					very strong safeguards against corruption, either accidental or malicious.
					These three criteria eliminated every then-existing version control system, except for Monotone. Considering performance excluded this too. So immediately after the 2.6.12-rc2 Linux kernel development release, Torvalds set out to write his own.</br></br>

					Torvalds has quipped about the name git, which is British English slang meaning "unpleasant person". Torvalds said: "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'." The man page describes Git as "the stupid content tracker".</br></br>

					The development of Git began on 3 April 2005. The project was announced on 6 April, and became self-hosting as of 7 April. The first merge of multiple branches was done on 18 April. Torvalds achieved his performance goals; on 29 April, the nascent Git was benchmarked recording patches to the Linux kernel tree at the rate of 6.7 per second. On 16 June Git managed the kernel 2.6.12 release. Torvalds turned over maintenance on 26 July 2005 to Junio Hamano, a major contributor to the project. Hamano was responsible for the 1.0 release on 21 December 2005, and remains the project's maintainer

                    <p>In the most simplest of terms, you create a repository (project), which you then make commits (saves)to. Everytime you make a commit, you have to leave a comment and description. This helps you keep track of the changes you've made. You can now go back and view every commit you've made. This is extremely useful in case you mess something up so bad you break everything. </br></br>You can also make branches. Think of branches like branches on a tree. Say you want to try and add a new responsive header, but you don't want to keep the one you have for now until you finish this one. You can create a new branch, work on and finish the new header, and then merge that with the main branch (the one you've been using all along).

                    <p>git is actually quite complex at first and there's a lot to go over. I'd recommend checking out <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control">their official documentation</a> to get started. I'd also recommend downloading the respective GitHub programs for Windows/OSX so you have a simply GUI to help you get started. </br></br>It's one of those things where it seems very confusing at first, but once you actually use it a few times you'll understand it pretty quickly.
